  This repository contains the transcription of the final "continuation" of the
  Seven Sages of Rome (C7S) in the French tradition, titled Le Roman de Kanor,
  specifically Li Histoire de Kanor et de ses freres. This text is preserved in
  manuscript BnF fr. 1446, a composite manuscript that reflects the complex
  history of the Seven Sages tradition. The version of Roman de Kanor, written
  in Old Picard prose during the 13th century, serves as the sixth and last
  continuation of this narrative cycle. It includes a reworking and partial
  abridgment of earlier continuations, such as the Roman de Pelyarmenus, and
  presents reworded material centered on Kanor and his brothers, sons of Emperor
  Cassidorus.


  The Seven Sages of Rome is a medieval frame story originating in the East,
  which entered Western literary traditions in the 12th century. It became
  widely popular in both verse and prose forms, with numerous adaptations across
  Europe. The Roman de Kanor stands out for its intricate plotlines involving
  themes like dynastic struggles, identity swaps, and moral lessons. The
  manuscript itself reflects broader cultural and political dynamics, including
  its likely connection to prominent patrons like Hugues II de Ch√¢tillon or Gui
  de Dampierre, suggesting its role in reinforcing dynastic ties and cultural
  prestige within medieval Francophone courts.
